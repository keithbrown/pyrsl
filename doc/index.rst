Welcome to pyrsl's documentation!
=================================
pyrsl is an interpreter for a language called RSL (Rule Specification Language).
RSL is commonly used as a template language to express transformations from a
`BridgePoint <https://www.xtuml.org>`__ model into a textual representation,
e.g. when writing model compilers or when generating html documentation from a
model.
